title: "Design systems that are simple to use"

## Keep it simple

Complicated systems that have not been designed to meet user needs cost local authorities time and money to implement. It can also undermine trust in the system and supplier.

Building and procuring tools that are clear and simple to use support good children's social practices, so that time and money can be spent supporting children and families.

Suppliers and local authorities should:

* ensure the system allows users to do what they need to do as simply as possible
* regularly test for usability with users of the system
* ensure all parts of the system are consistent for the user
* develop the system to work with a range of devices - for example, can be used on a social workers mobile device whilst on a visit

## Available guidance

* [User interface design](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-interface-design.html)
* [Designing for different browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices)

## Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:
 
* how user feedback has informed changes to the user interface (UI)
* how it is informed by practice
* how it meets the requirements for:
     * less clicks
     * no unnecessary workflows
     * easy creation of genograms and chronology
     * less recording
     * less duplication of effort
     * consistent terminology
     * mobile working
* how easy it is to use and understand (and any training support required) 
* a consistent approach to data input and workflow - for example, edit button always in the same place 
* how it can be used on different devices
* how it caters for all abilities 
* how it works with assistive technologies

## Challenges

Challenges can occur when there are competing requirements. For example, between the need to manage statutory data returns versus meeting the needs of the social worker to access and record information in a way that enables them to deliver good social care practice and reflect the voice of the child.
